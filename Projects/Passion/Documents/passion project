My Passion project:

When I was a kid I always used to wonder that there wasn't a single game where a computer brain beats a human brain.
So I always passionate about making a game where a human can never win and even if he comes up with a better solution to solve the puzzle,My system will automatically stores that solution so that not to let the player again to win.

So My game is a simple "Tic Tac Toe" in which I mainly concentrate on its graphics interface and on its best algorithm for not letting any player to win.

There will be levels of dificulties in this game where the probability of winning tends to '0' while you tend towards more difficulty level.

So my game is a challenging task which lets the user to think of a new and better solution and i want to add features like Unlimited tic tac toe and mega tic tac toe.
